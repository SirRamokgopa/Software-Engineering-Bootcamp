This Capstone project will allow you to demonstrate your competence in using variables, various data types, if statements, loops and nested structures.

In this Capstone Project, I created a simple game using Pygame. This project demonstrates an ability to apply my knowledge to new technologies and environments, and that I can teach myself to adapt to working with code libraries that are new to me, as well as testing my ability to understand and modify code that someone else has written.
