In this task, I created a simple program that allows a user to calculate their interest on an investment or calculate the amount that should be repaid on a home loan each month. The goal of this task was to apply my knowledge of variables and control structures.

For this task, it is assumed that a small financial company asked to create a program that allows the user to access two different financial calculators: an investment calculator and a home loan repayment calculator.
